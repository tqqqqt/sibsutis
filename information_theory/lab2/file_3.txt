organizations require specialized competent and qualified employees in the department to assist in the operations and successful completion of duties and responsibilities within the laboratory department there are certain data that require a prompt response but organizations cannot promptly respond to them due to the nature of operations and functions within the department barcombe furthermore most health care organizations have decentralized the functions within the laboratory department organizations in the health care industry decentralize the operations especially in the laboratory because different employees specialize in different areas therefore organizations decentralize the operations to enhance the utilization of the knowledge and expertise of individual employees within the organization jeffries and mcclean the decentralization of information based on the specialization of different personnel within the health care organization has affected the operation in the health care industry especially among employees within the laboratory department decentralization is expensive an organization requires an effective and large number of employees to coordinate the decentralization of information in the laboratory department effectively the organization will require competent and specialized employees well versed with result analysis collection and interpretation in each subdepartment this will require an organization to increase the number of employed personnel within the organization which is costly and most organizations strain to employ and maintain a large workforce dexter and traub there are several organizations in the global industry and economy although health care organizations are concerned with the wellbeing of human health

bielen and demoulin therefore since health care organizations are also concerned with profit maximization they must minimize the operating cost this will enable them to increase their levels of returns furthermore the quality of services offered by respective health care organizations determines customer turnout which also determines the levels of returns dexter abouleish and epstein organizations operate with limited resources different organizations compete for the same resources in the global economy which intensifies competition for resources in the economy this requires

competitive advantage an organization gains a competitive advantage in the global market if it acquires develops and maintains an effective and competent human resource team effective management of limited resources in organizations that have decentralized operations is not easy this has led to misappropriation and allocation of resources among health care organizations the laboratory department requires adequate resources to ensure the execution of functions within the department gibbs mcgrath and russell organizations have different goals and objectives these goals and objectives have priorities which are not easy to classify in a decentralized operation a decentralization system of operation ensures that individual departments are concerned with the achievement of the goals and objectives of the respective departments without considering the objectives of other departments within the organization this leads to confusion in operation in the organization especially within important departments such as the laboratory blake carter and richardson the achievements of the prioritized objectives enable an organization to achieve other goals and objectives within the organization the nature of objectives and goals determines their priorities in an organization greenall individual departments have projects which aid in the achievements of the goals and objectives of the organization too these projects implementation depends on their importance to an organization implementing projects based on their importance is a challenge for most organizations in the global economy successful completion of individual projects leads to the achievement of the overall goals and objectives of an organization braaf manias and riley projects achievements also depend on the priorities the prioritized projects achievements lead to the achievements of other projects which necessitates the achievements of the overall goals and objectives of the respective organization

reviews risks associated with individual projects within a portfolio effective management of risks ensures that an organization achieves its goals and objectives within the stated or stipulated time or deadline dante gawande and sara evaluation of risks in a decentralized system of operation is not easy this has led to the collapse and failure of several organizations in the global economy the decentralization system does not enable an organization to effectively assess risks and address them accordingly furthermore the decentralized system of operation does not enable an organization to share the risks that are associated with individual projects towards the achievements of the overall goals and objectives of the organization burnes most organizations in the health care industry adopt the decentralization system of operation however this system is not appropriate for use in laboratory departments the laboratory department is a major department in health care organizations it requires an effective and competent human resource team christian furthermore the laboratory department requires effective and appropriate strategies the strategies adopted for use in the laboratory department should ensure that an organization achieves its goals and objectives within the stated deadline or period the decentralization of information in the laboratory in most health care organizations has led to the failure of the collapse of several health care organizations calms and shusterich the decentralization of information hinders increased efficiency among health care organizations this has also affected the returns levels implementation of quality programs and initiation of new and effective projects within health care organizations furthermore effective management of risks within health care organizations has not been easy due to the decentralization system of operations brooks and brown the laboratory department should function effectively it should aid in the achievements of the goals and objectives of an organization is one of the major departments within health care organizations boushy and dubinsky however this is not possible in case a health care organization adopts the decentralization system of operation the decentralization system hinders increased efficiency in operation among health care organizations an organization requires effective strategies to enhance efficiency and achieve its goals and objectives within the stated deadline or period therefore health care organizations require a centralized system of operation to enhance efficiency develop and implement quality programs improve quality of services and increase returns levels among others cummings and worley
