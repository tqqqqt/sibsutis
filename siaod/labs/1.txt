I am a worm, I crawl from what strength I have
I am the Earth, I can feel
I am water (I am water), I came here to save myself
But, alas, I was born to give myself life and leave forever

[Bridge]
Into the ground, into the ground
Into the ground, into the ground
[chorus]
It hurts me, it hurts me
It hurts
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering
It hurts me, it hurts me
It hurts
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering

[Verse 2]
I wander around the world in fragments of the universe
And I don't find my meaning
From all my life
I am a human being, I can prove that I feel pain
And I feel fear
There will be no one like me in life anymore

[Pre-chorus]
It hurts me, it hurts me
It hurts
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering

[chorus]
It hurts me, it hurts me
It hurts
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering
Thunderstorm, thunderstorm is thundering
A thunderstorm is thundering, a thunderstorm is thundering
